**Principal Investigator / Researcher:** James Harwood

**Project Data Contact:** Chris Westcott

**Description:** Here's my brief description of our study. The aim is to see how we can best capture and store DMPs from the DMPOnline service.

**Institution:** University of Oxford

**Data Collection**

**What data will you collect or create?**

We will create a single text file, saved as a docx file. We could reuse data from applications held by funders. 

**How will the data be collected or created?**

The data will be copied from past applications, or entered by authors via the DMPOnline tool. Authors can then modify the DMP in the word file directly, turning the DMP into a live document. We might also provide the ability to create a DMP from scratch directy in the word file. 

**Documentation and Metadata**

**What documentation and metadata will accompany the data?**

Each DMP will be linked to its primary manuscript, a meta-data file incuding information about all collaborators and timelines, and (eventually) the published work. 

**Ethics and Legal Compliance**

**How will you manage any ethical issues?**

There are no ethical issues here. Any ethical issues relating to patient data will be the resposibility of the researcher, not Research:Well. 

**How will you manage copyright and Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) issues?**

Authors own all of their own data. We have access to it for machine analysis, but nothing more. Upon publication, the author may grant their publisher to take over ownership of all data - as long as this is permitted by the funder. 

**Storage and Backup**

**How will the data be stored and backed up during the research?**

Chris Westcott will be responsible for storing data on AWS and backed up on CLOCKSS. 

**How will you manage access and security?**

Authors can opt to share their manuscripts by a range of cloud storage solutions, including Dropbox, Box and Google Drive. We will also provide a custom built cloud sharing system which will be even high security. 

**Selection and Preservation**

**Which data are of long-term value and should be retained, shared, and/or preserved?**

All manuscripts should be preserved. We will not be responsible for preserving datasets, other than prompting researchers to deposit their data and provide URL links to it in their manuscripts. 

**What is the long-term preservation plan for the dataset?**

Data will be held in AWS and CLOCKSS, and the fees will be covered by the funding agency. 

**Data Sharing**

**How will you share the data?**

Links to the data will be provided in the body of manuscripts. Data will be entirely open access. The data will be made available in advance of publication, and all data will have persistent identifiers. 

**Are any restrictions on data sharing required?**

Data sharing requirements will be different for each author, so we'll have to be flexible here. OK just filling this up with more dummy text for now....blah blah blah dhajfh fdhaip fshaji. 

**Responsibilities and Resources**

**Who will be responsible for data management?**

Chris Westcott

**What resources will you require to deliver your plan?**

No resources
