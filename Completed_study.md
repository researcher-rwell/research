# Thoracic cage plasticity in prepubertal New Zealand white rabbits submitted to T1-T12 dorsal arthrodesis, computed tomography evaluation, echocardiographic assessment and cario-pulmonary measurements.

# Objectives:

The objectives of this study were to determine whether URB597, a selective inhibitor of FAAH, increases retinal ganglion cell (RGC) survival in an axotomy model of optic nerve injury, and to determine the contribution of CB1 and CB2 to the survival-promoting effects of URB597 in the retina. (Slusar et al., 2013)

# Ethical statement:

All animal experiments conformed to the British Home Office Regulations (Animal Scientific Procedures Act 1986; Project License PPL70/7162 to Prof Andrew Rice) and International Association for the Study of Pain guidelines [90] for the care and use of animals. (Huang et al., 2013).

# Study design:

Three groups of 20 mice each were studied. A. Wild type fed AIN 93 G diet; B. Wild type fed AIN 93 G diet supplemented with 0.1% quinine HCl; C. Wild type fed AIN 93 G diet supplemented with 0.01% quinine HCl. (Cettour-Rose et al., 2013).

In experiments for mechanical hypersensitivity development and pharmacological studies, animals were randomized into treatment groups by picking numbers out of a hat. In experiments for thigmotaxis and burrowing, random cage assignment to treatments or TNT/sham surgeries were applied by picking numbers out of a hat. (Huang et al., 2013).

The experimental unit (e.g. a single animal, group or cage of animals). In the study, n refers to number of animals, with five acquisitions from each slice, with a maximum of three slices obtained from each experimental animal used for each protocol (six animals each group). (Grasselli et al., 2013).

# Experimental procedures:

All rats were chronically implanted with epidural silverball electrodes under inhalation anesthesia (isoflurane 2–3% mixed with 30% oxygen (O2) and 70% nitrous oxide (N2O)). Prior to surgery, rats were given an i.p. injection of 5 mg/kg Carprophen (Rimadyl) as analgetic. (Jung et al., 2013) .

Except the burrowing assay, which was conducted from the beginning of the dark cycle, all other behavioural experiments were conducted in the light phase. (Huang et al., 2013).

The animals were tested in a square shaped apparatus which comprised of an E-shaped object area, which could be adapted for different contexts, abutting an E-shaped holding area, which was stable (Fig. 1). The apparatus was 59 cm long and 59 cm wide. Opaque guillotine doors divided the two areas (outer arm doors: 12 cm; central arm door: 24 cm) which could be opened and closed by the experimenter. (Ameen-Ali et al., 2012).

The subcutaneous (s.c.) route may be used for agents to prolong duration of action, the intravenous route (i.v.) avoids issues of first pass metabolism (number of doses restricted due to potential damage to veins), the intraperitoneal (i.p.) route using 27-30g needles when repeated injections are required, or by oral (p.o.) gavage in volumes of less than 5ml/kg. (Al-Izki et al., 2012).

# Experimental animals:

Male C57BL/6J mice (25.3 ± 1.4 g), aged 8–12 weeks, were included (n = 40). (Van Dijk et al., 2013). Twenty-two male Sprague–Dawley rats (Rattus norvegicus; Harlan Laboratories, Indianapolis, IN, USA) were obtained and acclimatized for at least 48 h. Vendor health reports indicated that the rats were free of known viral, bacterial and parasitic pathogens. (Katayama et al., 2013).

# Sample size:

Twenty eight healthy rats were divided into four groups of seven each. Animals of group I received distilled water (0.1 ml/day) and served as control, whereas group II animals received only ISO at 100 mg/kg. Animals of group III and IV were treated with test alkaloid at pre-standardized dose of 40 mg/kg (p.o.) daily for 7 days. Power calculation is (Panda et al., 2013).

# Allocating animals to experimental groups:

For experiments using animals without surgery, rats were ranked in ascending order according to pre-test levels of burrowing and allocated to treatment groups in order i.e. rat 1 group 1, rat 2 group 2, rat 3 group 3, rat 4 group 1, etc., thus ensuring the median of each group was similar prior to testing. (Andrews et al., 2011).

For the thigmotaxis experiment, sequences of A–B–C then C–B–A (letters assigned to mask the cage labels during testing) were used to select animals. (Huang et al., 2013).

# Experimental outcomes: 

Two primary outcome measures were analyzed: overall performance on the MWM (days 12- 16) and the numbers of surviving CA2-3 cells. In addition, three secondary outcome measures were evaluated: terminal performance in the MWM (days 15-16), rate of learning the MWM (slope of days 12-14), and MWM probe trial. (Wang et al., 2013).

# Statistical methods: 

Kaplan–Meier survival analysis was performed and student t-test for normally distributed data (i.e., body weight, ABGA results, blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature, asphyxia time, CPR duration, and lactate) or Mann–Whitney U tests for non-normally distributed data (i.e., western blot results and immunohistochemistry results) were performed to compare the differences of baseline characteristics, and expressions of cleaved caspase-3 and acetylated histone H3. For NDS, repeated measures analysis of variance test and Bonferroni posthoc test was performed. (Hyuk et al., 2013)

For each test, the experimental unit was an individual animal. (Podrini et al., 2013) Test for normality was performed by Kolmogorov–Smirnov test. (Hyuk et al., 2013).
