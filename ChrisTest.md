# Abstract

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Asthma is an inflammatory disease that involves airway hyperresponsiveness and remodelling. Flavonoids have been associated to anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities and may represent a potential therapeutic treatment of asthma. Our aim was to evaluate the effects of the sakuranetin treatment in several aspects of experimental asthma model in mice.

EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Male BALB/c mice received ovalbumin (i.p.) on days 0 and 14, and were challenged with aerolized ovalbumin 1% on days 24, 26 and 28. Ovalbumin-sensitized animals received vehicle (saline and dimethyl sulfoxide, DMSO), sakuranetin (20 mg kg–1per mice) or dexamethasone (5 mg kg–1 per mice) daily beginning from 24th to 29th day. Control group received saline inhalation and nasal drop vehicle. On day 29, we determined the airway hyperresponsiveness, inflammation and remodelling as well as specific IgE antibody. RANTES, IL-5, IL-4, Eotaxin, IL-10, TNF-a, IFN-g and GMC-SF content in lung homogenate was performed by Bioplex assay, and 8-isoprostane and NF-kB activations were visualized in inflammatory cells by immunohistochemistry.

KEY RESULTS: We have demonstrated that sakuranetin treatment attenuated airway hyperresponsiveness, inflammation and remodelling; and these effects could be attributed to Th2 pro-inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress reduction as well as control of NF-kB activation.

CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: These results highlighted the importance of counteracting oxidative stress by flavonoids in this asthma model and suggest sakuranetin as a potential candidate for studies of treatment of asthma. (Toledo et al., 2013).

# Background:

The increasing prevalence of type 2 diabetes is cause for concern, and has spurred efforts to identify novel peptides with valuable properties for diabetes treatment [1]. Type 2 diabetes is characterized by both resistance of target tissues to the actions of insulin and impaired β-cell function [2], [3]. Studies in genetically modified mice have suggested that defects in insulin/IGF signaling in the β-cell contribute to β- cell failure [4], thereby establishing a causal link between insulin resistance and impaired β-cell function. One attractive scenario is that insulin and IGFs exert their effects through a common effector, acting on DNA transcription in β-cells [5]. Forkhead box (Fox)-containing transcription factors of the O sub-class (FoxO) are prominent transcriptional effectors of insulin and IGF signaling in β-cells [6]. FoxO1 inhibits β-cell proliferation in insulin-resistant states [7] as well as in response to growth factors [8], protects β-cells against hyperglycemia-induced oxidative stress [9], and controls energy metabolism in β-cells [10]. In view of the role of FoxO1 in β-cell compensation to insulin resistance [11], we reasoned that investigation of FoxO1 target genes could reveal mechanisms underlying β-cell failure in the context of insulin resistance. To this end, we carried out gene profiling analyses in INS832/13 cells [10]. Our genomic analysis led to the identification of nephroblastoma overexpressed gene (Nov, also known as Ccn3) as a novel FoxO1 target. The role of Ccn3 in β-cells has never been explored. (Paradis et al., 2013)

For this purpose, we selected a pilocarpine model of epilepsy that is characterized by robust, frequent spontaneous seizures acquired after a brain insult [15, 16, 17, 18] well-described behavioral abnormalities [18] and poor responses to antiepileptic drugs [19]. These animals recapitulate several key features of human temporal lobe epilepsy, the most common type of epilepsy in adults [1, 2]. (Hunt et al., 2013)

# Ethical statement:

All animal experiments conformed to the British Home Office Regulations (Animal Scientific Procedures Act 1986; Project License PPL70/7162 to Prof Andrew Rice) and International Association for the Study of Pain guidelines [90] for the care and use of animals. (Huang et al., 2013).

# Study design:

Three groups of 20 mice each were studied. A. Wild type fed AIN 93 G diet; B. Wild type fed AIN 93 G diet supplemented with 0.1% quinine HCl; C. Wild type fed AIN 93 G diet supplemented with 0.01% quinine HCl. (Cettour-Rose et al., 2013).

In experiments for mechanical hypersensitivity development and pharmacological studies, animals were randomized into treatment groups by picking numbers out of a hat. In experiments for thigmotaxis and burrowing, random cage assignment to treatments or TNT/sham surgeries were applied by picking numbers out of a hat. (Huang et al., 2013).

The experimental unit (e.g. a single animal, group or cage of animals). In the study, n refers to number of animals, with five acquisitions from each slice, with a maximum of three slices obtained from each experimental animal used for each protocol (six animals each group). (Grasselli et al., 2013).

# Experimental procedures:

All rats were chronically implanted with epidural silverball electrodes under inhalation anesthesia (isoflurane 2–3% mixed with 30% oxygen (O2) and 70% nitrous oxide (N2O)). Prior to surgery, rats were given an i.p. injection of 5 mg/kg Carprophen (Rimadyl) as analgetic. (Jung et al., 2013) .

Except the burrowing assay, which was conducted from the beginning of the dark cycle, all other behavioural experiments were conducted in the light phase. (Huang et al., 2013).

The animals were tested in a square shaped apparatus which comprised of an E-shaped object area, which could be adapted for different contexts, abutting an E-shaped holding area, which was stable (Fig. 1). The apparatus was 59 cm long and 59 cm wide. Opaque guillotine doors divided the two areas (outer arm doors: 12 cm; central arm door: 24 cm) which could be opened and closed by the experimenter. (Ameen-Ali et al., 2012).

The subcutaneous (s.c.) route may be used for agents to prolong duration of action, the intravenous route (i.v.) avoids issues of first pass metabolism (number of doses restricted due to potential damage to veins), the intraperitoneal (i.p.) route using 27-30g needles when repeated injections are required, or by oral (p.o.) gavage in volumes of less than 5ml/kg. (Al-Izki et al., 2012).

# Experimental animals:

Male C57BL/6J mice (25.3 ± 1.4 g), aged 8–12 weeks, were included (n = 40). (Van Dijk et al., 2013). Twenty-two male Sprague–Dawley rats (Rattus norvegicus; Harlan Laboratories, Indianapolis, IN, USA) were obtained and acclimatized for at least 48 h. Vendor health reports indicated that the rats were free of known viral, bacterial and parasitic pathogens. (Katayama et al., 2013).

# Sample size:

Twenty eight healthy rats were divided into four groups of seven each. Animals of group I received distilled water (0.1 ml/day) and served as control, whereas group II animals received only ISO at 100 mg/kg. Animals of group III and IV were treated with test alkaloid at pre-standardized dose of 40 mg/kg (p.o.) daily for 7 days. (Panda et al., 2013).

# Allocating animals to experimental groups:

For experiments using animals without surgery, rats were ranked in ascending order according to pre-test levels of burrowing and allocated to treatment groups in order i.e. rat 1 group 1, rat 2 group 2, rat 3 group 3, rat 4 group 1, etc., thus ensuring the median of each group was similar prior to testing. (Andrews et al., 2011).

For the thigmotaxis experiment, sequences of A–B–C then C–B–A (letters assigned to mask the cage labels during testing) were used to select animals. (Huang et al., 2013).

# Experimental outcomes: 

Two primary outcome measures were analyzed: overall performance on the MWM (days 12- 16) and the numbers of surviving CA2-3 cells. In addition, three secondary outcome measures were evaluated: terminal performance in the MWM (days 15-16), rate of learning the MWM (slope of days 12-14), and MWM probe trial. (Wang et al., 2013).

# Statistical methods: 

Kaplan–Meier survival analysis was performed and student t-test for normally distributed data (i.e., body weight, ABGA results, blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature, asphyxia time, CPR duration, and lactate) or Mann–Whitney U tests for non-normally distributed data (i.e., western blot results and immunohistochemistry results) were performed to compare the differences of baseline characteristics, and expressions of cleaved caspase-3 and acetylated histone H3. For NDS, repeated measures analysis of variance test and Bonferroni posthoc test was performed. (Hyuk et al., 2013)

For each test, the experimental unit was an individual animal. (Podrini et al., 2013) Test for normality was performed by Kolmogorov–Smirnov test. (Hyuk et al., 2013).

# Baseline data: 

The animals’ health status was monitored throughout the experiments by a health surveillance programme according to Federation of European Laboratory Animal Science Associations (FELASA) guidelines. The mice were free of all viral, bacterial, and parasitic pathogens listed in the FELASA recommendations, except for Helicobacter species. (Jirkof et al., 2013).

# Numbers analysed: 

Sixteen MPV-positive samples were from the group of young adults, with a positive rate of 13.9% (16/115), and the other four positive samples were detected in the middle-aged adult group, with a positive rate of 11.4% (4/35) (Table 1). (Wang et al., 2013).

Thirty-eight rats were utilized for this study and 30 were included and completed. Eight animals were excluded, including 5 rats which were not resuscitated (persistent VF during ECLS) and another 3 rats were excluded because of instrumentation or technical failure during animal preparation. (Rungatscher et al., 2013).

# Outcomes estimation: 

In accordance with the ARRIVE guidelines (Kilkenny et al. 2010), we have reported measures of precision, confidence, and n to provide an indication of significance.

Cages of mice were randomly assigned to each of the five groups (n = 30 per group).

Fig. 2 Comparison of body weight of C57BL/6NTac male mice following varying durations of exposure to HFD. a Percentage body weight gain from 4 to 16 weeks of age relative to the starting body weight at 4 weeks of age which ranged from 12.2 to 20.3 g (mean = 16.9 g). Data are presented as mean percentage weight gain ± SEM. (Podrini et al., 2013).

# Adverse events: 

In four surviving animals, lower extremity ulcers developed but were effectively treated with local standard triple antibiotic ointment (bacitracin, neomycin, and Polymyxin B) and cohesive bandages. (Van Gorp et al., 2013).

As mortality with multiple surgeries was significantly higher in aged animals than young animals, aged animals only underwent a single surgery in which RGCs were labelled either from the SC (aged control nonaxotomized animals) or from the optic nerve stump at the time of axotomy. (Slusar et al., 2013).

# Interpretation/scientific implications: 

The aim of our study was to verify if the pharmacological manipulation of the endocannabinoid system could be effective in the modulation of abnormal eating behaviour developed by female rats in a confirmed rat model of BED, in which binge eating behaviour is induced in animals by giving them a sporadic (3 days week-1) and limited (2 h) access to a high-fat diet (margarine) in addition to a continuous access to chow and water (HR group). In these animals, the intake of margarine becomes significantly greater than those of animals with limited daily access to margarine (LR group), and remains stable over prolonged periods of time (Corwin and Buda-Levin, 2004; Corwin and Wojnicki, 2006).In our study, the effect of rimonabant on the bingeing group could be related to its capacity to block dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens shell that might be induced by the consumption of margarine, and by a possible enhancement in the tone of the endocannabinoid system. Chronic exposure to high-fat palatable diet was found to decrease the expression of CB1 receptors in the nucleus accumbens (Harrold et al., 2002). Accordingly, Bello et al. (2012) reported a reduction in CB1 receptor density in the same central area in an animal model of BED. (Scherma et al., 2013).

A limitation of this study is the fact that the estrous cycle stage of the female rats was not determined, since the stage of the estrus cycle at the time of tissue collection could potentially have affected gene expression levels. (Ong et al., 2013).

The new apparatus shows potential for considerably reducing the number of animals used in memory tasks designed to detect potential amnesic properties of new drugs ….. approximately 43,000 animals have been used in these tasks in the past 5 years but with the application of the continual trials apparatus we estimate that this could have been reduce to 26,000. (Ameen-Ali et al., 2013).

# Generalisability/Translation: 

Establishing anesthesia-independent settings for probing rodent analogues to the human MMN are important for facilitating the detection of therapeutic targets at the cellular level. Knowledge of these targets is likely to help guiding the development of drugs for treating the disorders that have been shown to be accompanied with reduced MMN responses, such as schizophrenia. (Jung et al., 2013).
